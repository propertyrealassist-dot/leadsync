## üîí Security Best Practices

### 1. Protect Your Client ID

- ‚úÖ **Never share** your Client ID publicly
- ‚úÖ **Use environment variables** in GHL custom values
- ‚úÖ **Rotate** your API key if compromised (Settings ‚Üí Regenerate)

### 2. Use HTTPS Only

- ‚úÖ **Always use HTTPS** for webhook URL
- ‚ùå **Never use HTTP** - GHL may reject insecure webhooks

### 3. Whitelist GHL IPs (Optional)

If you want extra security, whitelist GHL webhook IPs:
```
52.90.176.0/20
54.208.0.0/16
```

### 4. Monitor Webhook Logs

Regularly check:
- ‚úÖ Unauthorized access attempts
- ‚úÖ Unusual traffic patterns
- ‚úÖ Failed authentication logs

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Problem 1: Workflow Not Triggering

**Symptoms:**
- Inbound SMS received but workflow doesn't start

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Check workflow is **ACTIVE** (not paused)
2. ‚úÖ Verify trigger conditions match (SMS type, direction)
3. ‚úÖ Check if contact has required tags (if using tag filters)
4. ‚úÖ View GHL workflow logs for errors

### Problem 2: Webhook Returns 401 Unauthorized

**Symptoms:**
- Workflow logs show "401 Unauthorized" error
- No AI response sent

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Verify Client ID is correct (copy from LeadSync Settings)
2. ‚úÖ Check Client ID is in webhook headers OR body
3. ‚úÖ Ensure your LeadSync account is active
4. ‚úÖ Check LeadSync backend logs for authentication errors

### Problem 3: No AI Response Received

**Symptoms:**
- Webhook succeeds (200 OK) but no AI message sent
- Fallback message sent instead

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Check you have AI Strategies configured in LeadSync
2. ‚úÖ Verify contact tags match your AI Strategy tags
3. ‚úÖ Check Claude API key is valid (LeadSync backend logs)
4. ‚úÖ Verify you have Claude API credits remaining

### Problem 4: Response Too Slow

**Symptoms:**
- AI response takes more than 10 seconds
- Sometimes times out

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Check your LeadSync backend response time in logs
2. ‚úÖ Verify Claude API is responding quickly (should be < 2s)
3. ‚úÖ Increase GHL webhook timeout to 30 seconds
4. ‚úÖ Consider adding a "typing indicator" action before webhook

### Problem 5: Wrong AI Strategy Used

**Symptoms:**
- AI response doesn't match expected strategy
- Generic responses instead of specialized

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Verify contact has correct tags in GHL
2. ‚úÖ Check tag matching in LeadSync AI Strategies
3. ‚úÖ Review LeadSync logs to see which strategy was matched
4. ‚úÖ Ensure tag names match exactly (case-sensitive)

1. **Add Action 1.5** (between webhook and response):
   - Type: Delay

### Multiple Response Messages

Split long AI responses:

1. **Add condition:** Check response length
2. **If > 160 characters:**

   - Send with 1-second delays

### Tag Contacts Based on Intent

Automatically tag contacts:

1. **Add Action 5:**

2. **If detected:**
   - Stop AI workflow
   - Assign conversation to user
   - Send notification to team

## üìä Monitoring & Analytics

### Track Performance

**In GHL:**
